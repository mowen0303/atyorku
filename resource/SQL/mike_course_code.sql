For each idea/topic/problem relevant mathematical ideas and techniques are recalled and/or derived so as to provide a deeper understanding of the Economic issue and how it can be resolved, if necessary. The notion of Quantity Demanded is first addressed by expressing quantity demanded as a linear function of price where both the slope and intercept embed important Economics ideas. This sequence leads naturally to the notion of Revenue (the product of quantity demanded and price) where nonlinear functions are analyzed using mathematical techniques that include derivatives. This sequence culminates with notions of prices that maximize revenue subject to a given demand function. A large number of such topic sequences involving univariate functions are examined.

The ability to evaluate the quality of data and to make generalizations from it using the principles of statistical inference are critical skills for all mangers. The second objective of the course is to show how risk and uncertainty can be incorporated into decision making using techniques such as Probability theory and Bayesian inference. The third objective to show how data is qualitatively evaluated using the principles of evidence. Managers should be adept in evaluating both the sufficiency and persuasiveness of evidence used in decision models. The fourth objective is to show students how to prepare a research proposal to address any business problem. This is obviously essential for students pursuing the major paper option, but any manager benefits from recognizing when sound methodological principles have been followed in researching a business question.

This course focuses on nineteenth century British and European science and its social, political, cultural, and intellectual contexts. Adopting the contextualist approach to the history of science allows us to raise a series of provocative questions: in what way did all of these different contexts shape the nature of nineteenth century scientific thought? How were scientific facts socially constructed? What was it about the nineteenth century context that led many intellectuals to reject Christianity and embrace science as providing a new, privileged form of knowledge? Included among the topics to be covered are the discourse of natural theology, the politics of geological controversy, Scottish philosophy and phrenology, radical working class Lamarckianism in England during the 1830s, the plurality of worlds debate, science and gender, the professionalization of science, English scientific naturalism and German scientific materialism, the literary structure of Darwin\'s Origin of Species, Darwinian theory and its ideological uses, and late nineteenth century physics and psychics. This course will be of interest to students of British, European, social, and intellectual history.', 6),

We discuss how we can use the corpses of stars (white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes) to probe how space and time are related via Einstein\'s theories of relativity. We examine how stars are bound together into galaxies by gravity and how to use various wavelengths of light to determine why there are different types of galaxies: elegant spirals, massive ellipticals, and faint dwarf galaxies. We learn how the Doppler effect reveals that dark matter must produce some of the gravity that binds stars into galaxies, galaxies into clusters of galaxies, and clusters of galaxies into superclusters. We explore how we can use distant galaxies to study the development of the universe over its entire history, including the increasing importance of dark energy. We confront both the earliest instants and the far future of our universe\'s history: what we know, what we still hope to learn, and what we think we can ever learn.

This course provides tools with which to better think about the relationship between science, scientific experts, citizens and what people think they know. We cover different cases in which claims about technical scientific facts interact, and often clash, with political and social arguments about those facts. Cases may include vaccination, anthropogenic climate change and what to do about it, and genetic engineering. For each case we first cover a \'primer\' on the technical issues - for instance learning how a gene codes for a protein - so that after this course when you come across such material you\'ll be better able to correctly grasp the relevant points. But we also study the enduring tension between expertise and democratic populism, the distinction between risk and uncertainty, and whether ignorance is a lack of knowledge....or the wrong knowledge confidently held. While no one can become an expert after taking a single course, NATS 1765 will help you better think about some of the most important issues of our time. Prerequisites: none. Corequisites: none.

This course asks: What can we learn about international politics from popular culture? The common notions of international politics are certainly found in many of the expressions or contemporary popular culture: novels, television, and, particularly, film have made the world of international espionage one of its staples. With the declaration of a \'war on terror\' in 2001, terrorists and the provision of security against them have also provided important themes for popular entertainments. However, by virtue of being \'popular\', popular culture also presents the possibilities of politics that are not abstracted and insulated from the concerns and experiences of everyday life and experience. Thus, while international politics in popular culture can reproduce alienated or elite versions of our world\'s politics it can also be a site of resistance, and even more importantly a place to imagine international politics differently. This course draws the popular culture in which we all live in our \'daily\' lives into the classroom, beginning from popular culture expressions to explore the nature, limits, and possibilities of contemporary international politics.
