However, the statements are based on management's financial reporting objectives (e.g. profit maximization; income smoothing; tax minimization), as well as on many management estimates and disclosure decisions. Statements based on GAAP do not usually reflect the needs of the individual user. In this course, students will learn to apply diagnostic, analytical and judgmental skills to understanding financial statements from the point of view of external users who need to make various types of decisions such as performance evaluation, loan decisions, and stock valuation.

They are used for testimony of the self or others, for witnessing others, and to recall and situate memories. Within this context, this course enquires into graphic narratives, more concisely called comics (the combined literary and graphic genre inclusive of graphic novels, online comics, and mini comic zines) that have been created by and about persons or groups of people that have been marginalized by society for their race, culture, disability, gender, sexual identity or orientation and weaves critical theories through their reading. The comics form is unique precisely because they can serve as a visual witness to the embodied lives lived outside the normative social structure and can work to make space for subjugated knowledge. The theoretical foundations of this course will be two-fold. The comics will be viewed through critical anti-oppressive theories such as critical race theory, feminisms, disability and queer theory. Alongside, comics theories will provide the student with insight into the general mechanics of the medium: the framing and pacing of the panels, the gutters between, and the iconic speech bubbles. Combined, these theories will guide students to understand how specifically comics can work to disrupt dominant narratives and has become a quiet but powerful social activist art form.

In East Asia, the development of "modern" design histories began with cultural translation through Western culture in the late nineteenth century. The term "design" itself raises complex questions that are currently under investigation, reflecting an interest in cultural translation and transnational studies within postcolonial studies. This course will explore how modern design in East Asia has been adapted, practiced, theorized and discussed as an interactive process between heritage rich cultures of East Asia and modernism in the West. We will examine the terminology of "design" in the East Asian context, key designers and their works, movements, and definitions and developments-oriental modernity, nationalism and political ideology-within regional and international design frameworks. Through this examination, students will explore the significance of the connections between design artefacts and everyday life. This course will stimulate a transnational and interdisciplinary understanding of material culture in the age of globalization by reflecting on the past, present and future of East Asian design.

For each idea/topic/problem relevant mathematical ideas and techniques are recalled and/or derived so as to provide a deeper understanding of the Economic issue and how it can be resolved, if necessary. The notion of Quantity Demanded is first addressed by expressing quantity demanded as a linear function of price where both the slope and intercept embed important Economics ideas. This sequence leads naturally to the notion of Revenue (the product of quantity demanded and price) where nonlinear functions are analyzed using mathematical techniques that include derivatives. This sequence culminates with notions of prices that maximize revenue subject to a given demand function. A large number of such topic sequences involving univariate functions are examined.

Again, relevant mathematical ideas and techniques are recalled and/or derived so as to provide a deeper understanding of Economic issues and how they can be resolved. The issues and problems covered require functions of more than one variable for their resolution. The notion of Quantity Supplied is combined with the notion of Quantity Demanded and notions of Market Equilibrium are introduced and discussed. Equilibria are evaluated through the introduction of mathematical notions and properties of systems of equations, eventually in matrix form. A deeper understanding of theories of demand (supply) and the foundations of demand (supply) functions is developed through the introduction of mathematical notions of unconstrained and constrained optimization and linear and nonlinear programming. As in AP/ECON 1530 3.00, many topics and issues are addressed and problem framing and problem solving abilities are enhanced. Prerequisite: AP/ECON 1530 3.00 or equivalent.

Drawing on classical and contemporary philosophy and theory we will explore how education is concerned with cultivating the human and the possibility of a common world. To wonder again about what education is for  in an existential, political and ethical sense  we will ask about the nature of authority, power and freedom, about what justifies and bounds our interactions in education, and about the possibility of fostering the philosophical soul.</description></course><course><courseCode>EDST 1100</courseCode><credit>3.00</credit><courseTitle>Situated Learning and Education</courseTitle><description>Situated theories of learning are introduced in this course and contrasted with other theories of learning. Situated learning theories also are critically examined in relation to the kinds of educational experiences that flow from the manner in which learning is framed, who or what the teacher is in any one instance of learning, how the learner is positioned, and the role of the interpersonal dynamics such as affect and power. The implications of situated theories of learning are considered in relation to the provisioning of educational experiences in a variety of contexts, with particular reference to a life-long learning perspective.</description></course><course><courseCode>EDST 1200</courseCode><credit>3.00</credit><courseTitle>Place and Learning</courseTitle><description>Physical spaces invite certain types of engagements with the world while precluding others. This course explores the role of physical spaces in learning with specific reference to emotion, curiosity and relationality. Drawing on scholarship from a range of disciplines including geography, architecture, design, environmental studies and education, the course: a) reviews the history of thinking about the design of "instructional space" in schools, museums, galleries and other spaces intended to support learning; investigate the learning potential of other spaces, natural (wilderness, desert, etc.) and human-made (malls, street corners, etc.); b) considers the conditions that inhibit and inspire learning; and c) explores the implications for individual learning, public education, and civic engagement.</description></course><course><courseCode>EDST 2450</courseCode><credit>3.00</credit><courseTitle>Multilingualism and multiculturalism in educational contexts</courseTitle><description>This course explores cultural diversity and linguistic pluralism in super-diverse societies; examines social history and cultural identity against language policy, pedagogy, and social practice; and considers how education in multicultural societies can be redesigned for successful, cooperative learning outcomes.

Novels, films, exhibitions, photography, and memorials are among the types of representations that may be examined in the course. The course considers how cultural representations of pedagogy affect contemporary ideas about teaching and learning. Social institutions and popular culture have the capacity to create, not just reflect, knowledge. A central assumption of the course is that cultural representations impact the ways that educators understand themselves and their work. The course raises questions about the significance of cultural depictions, their historical and social formation, and their value for theorizing multiple learning environments.</description></course><course><courseCode>EDST 2700</courseCode><credit>3.00</credit><courseTitle>Teaching Internationally and Interculturally</courseTitle><description>This course engages students in a comparative and international exploration of cultural traditions and beliefs, as well as their reflection on schooling and teaching practices. Throughout the course, students will examine diverse cultural and educational contexts in Canada and around the world in relation to imperialism, globalization, and internationalization, and raise questions about critical issues such as social class, race, ethnicity and gender. Students will be encouraged to develop an understanding of education in political, social, economic, linguistic, and cultural contexts around the world and search for effective pedagogical practices for teaching students of diverse cultural, class, racial, ethnic, and language backgrounds both locally and internationally.

It examines the ways in which governments create educational policy and the influence that non-government organizations, such as cultural advocates, business and labour associations, parent groups, and social movements have in the world of schooling, college and universities. It studies the influence of those who lack direct authority over educational institutions but who may well influence the agendas and policy choices of governments, school boards, post-secondary educational decision-making bodies. Specifically, it looks at parent councils, lobby groups, teacher unions, business representatives, and Aboriginal associations. By way of illustration, it explores the topics of special education and the politics of race and schooling and it assesses the role of the media in shaping educational perspectives. Finally, it looks at policy-making in post-secondary education as well as the relationships between institutions (i.e. colleges, universities) and the communities in which they are located. The course should be of interest to those seeking to understand the process of educational change, the ways in which the educational community, writ large, contributes to such change, and the role of education in modern society.

This course will offer opportunities for future PJ and JI teachers to explore these key mathematical processes, identified in the Ontario curriculum, through investigations, reflections, and selective readings from the literature. Many pre-service teachers have not themselves experienced learning and doing mathematics with these broader, more connected and inclusive approaches. They lack the confidence and the background resources to support these mathematical processes and approaches with their students. Reworking sample mathematics with these supports, including manipulatives (as described in the Ontario Curriculum) and appropriate technology (dynamic geometry, as identified in the Ontario Curriculum) provides opportunities for future teachers to develop their mathematical repertoire and confidence, as well as their capacity to offer active engagement with multiple approaches that can support the diversity of student thinking found in problem solving situations. The activities selected, and the associated group projects, will also cross-curricular boundaries and cultural boundaries to connect mathematics and spatial reasoning to real world experiences. These activities and reflections will also connect to learning objectives and concepts from science, social sciences such as geography, and visual arts, supporting a broad range of connected student learning in the STEM and STEAM disciplines, and beyond. A key component will be building and exploring embodied approaches, including spatial reasoning, kinesthetic and spatial-visual representations to support learning and thinking for children and in the elementary classrooms. These approaches are also central in the practices of mathematics, the sciences and many of the arts, at all levels and across most cultures. They will support a lifetime of student and teacher learning.</description></course><course><courseCode>EDUC 2700</courseCode><credit>3.00</credit><courseTitle>Teaching Internationally and Interculturally</courseTitle><description>This course engages students in a comparative and international exploration of cultural traditions and beliefs, as well as their reflection on schooling and teaching practices.

The enormous size of today's data sets and the specific requirements of modern applications necessitated the growth of a new generation of data management systems, where the emphasis is put on distributed and fault-tolerant processing. New programming paradigms have evolved, an abundance of information platforms offering data management and analysis solutions appeared and a number of novel methods and tools have been developed. This course introduces the fundamentals of big data storage, retrieval, and processing systems. As these fundamentals are introduced, exemplary technologies are used to illustrate how big data systems can leverage very large data sets that become available through multiple sources and are characterized by diverse levels of volume (terabytes; billion records), velocity (batch; real-time; streaming) and variety (structured; semi-structured; unstructured). The course aims to provide students with both theoretical knowledge and practical experience of the field by covering recent research on big data systems and their basic properties. Students consider both small and large datasets because both are equally important and justify different trade-offs. Topics include: software frameworks for distributed storage and processing of very large data sets, MapReduce programming model, querying of structured data sets, column stores, key-value stores, document stores, graph databases, distributed stream processing frameworks.

The function of memory in individual and collective identity has become an object of inquiry in many academic disciplines, introducing reflexive analysis of archiving processes into the long-standing evidentiary function of the archive in the historical study of empirical reality. The advent of digital technologies with their shift in the techniques of conservation and classification and a consequent rhetoric of instantaneity and simultaneity, has provoked a sense of imminent breakdown in the protocols of transmission of the traces of the past, even as digitization renews the utopian impulse of the archive in its embodiment of desire for mastery of a quasi-infinity of cultural materials. The dialectic of accumulation and dissemination-of hierarchization and destabilization--is only one of the paradoxes generated by the archive. Both a physical site--an enclosed institutional space--it is also an imaginative site, a conceptual space of changing limits. The physical space that contains them, the archive is also the material traces of the past so contained. Additionally, noun metamorphoses into a verb, associated with the ensemble of operations within this space that confers order on the contents in the creation of a system of classification so as to sift, interpret and transmit material traces. To archive documents is to enclose them in a myriad of complex containers--stone, metal, acid-free folders, or even electronic pulses--that structure the archivable content as it comes into existence and in its relation to the future. Archiving contributes thus to the transformation of documents into monuments with symbolic functions. Yet despite its etymology that signifies both "origin" and "command," the archive confounds beginnings and order alike as it exceeds the logic of historical temporality: its teleological function and claims to universality are short-circuited in its un</description></course><course><courseCode>EN 7000</courseCode><credit>0.00</credit><courseTitle>Dissertation Proposal Writing Workshop</courseTitle><description>This writing workshop analyses the components of the dissertation proposal, discusses appropriate writing strategies, and provides a faculty-member-facilitated, peer-review setting for students to develop their dissertation topics and draft their proposals according to Faculty of Graduate Studies' guidelines.</description></course></courseSubject><courseSubject><courseSubjectCode>ENG</courseSubjectCode><courseSubjectTitle>Engineering</courseSubjectTitle><course><courseCode>ENG 1101</courseCode><credit>4.00</credit><courseTitle>Renaissance Engineer 1: Ethics, Communication &amp; Problem Solving</courseTitle><description>Who is an engineer and what are his/her ethical and academic integrity obligations; communications strategies for technical subjects in oral and written forms; dealing with ambiguity, uncertainties, and open ended problems in a technical context, problem definition strategies.</description></course><course><courseCode>ENG 1102</courseCode><credit>4.00</credit><courseTitle>Renaissance Engineer 2: Engineering Design Principles</courseTitle><description>This course will cover: engineering design methodology; features and elements of good design with environment and human interface considerations; aesthetics in design and idea communication using graphics and technical drawings.

First, it aims at fostering those language skills which students using English as a second language need to succeed academically in the multicultural, English-medium context at York. The course accomplishes this goal primarily through content, rather than explicit language exercises, as is appropriate to learners at the university level. Second, the course aims to promote students' awareness of various aspects of Canadian society through the discussion and analysis of a range of texts exploring themes such as language and communication, culture and identity, and Canada's diverse communities. Note: This course comprises the English as a second language requirement for incoming English as a second language students.

Students are exposed to theory and skills that foster critical reading, writing, speaking, thinking, and reasoning. Students apply theory and skills to the analysis of timely culturally relevant social, ethical, and/or pop culture issues. Given the smaller class size, students can expect opportunities of continued experiential education built into the course. Finally, students can expect to see real improvement in their abilities to be both respectfully curious individuals and reasonable skeptics - practices that are helpful in other academic courses and life generally. Students who have been admitted to York University with an ESL requirement, or can demonstrate an ESL need, will be given permission to enrol in this course.

The first is to help students take a more structured and scientific approach to the evaluation of data. Managers are literally bombarded with data (the information overload problem) and must be able to filter and assess the quality of such data before inputting into managerial decision models. The ability to evaluate the quality of data and to make generalizations from it using the principles of statistical inference are critical skills for all mangers. The second objective of the course is to show how risk and uncertainty can be incorporated into decision making using techniques such as Probability theory and Bayesian inference. The third objective to show how data is qualitatively evaluated using the principles of evidence. Managers should be adept in evaluating both the sufficiency and persuasiveness of evidence used in decision models. The fourth objective is to show students how to prepare a research proposal to address any business problem. This is obviously essential for students pursuing the major paper option, but any manager benefits from recognizing when sound methodological principles have been followed in researching a business question. Managers read and possibly rely on many research reports over their careers and it is important to be able to distinguish good research from weak research.</description></course><course><courseCode>FACC 6500</courseCode><credit>3.00</credit><courseTitle>Corporate Governance</courseTitle><description>Effective corporate governance is crucial to a successful and sustainable corporate enterprise.

It is also a common belief that compensation schemes tied to the bottom line and stock price lead to actions more in the manager's interest than the firm's interest. This course looks at these issues and identifies best practices to strengthen corporate governance and accountability in the organization through appropriate design of executive compensation schemes. The revised course description reflects the reality that executive compensation dominates all benefits in terms of impact on accountability and governance.</description></course><course><courseCode>FACC 6800</courseCode><credit>3.00</credit><courseTitle>Synthesis of theory and practice, governance and accountability</courseTitle><description>Capstone course In the Graduate Program in Financial Accountability which integrates theories and practices from the previous courses and applies them in an experiential learning format.</description></course><course><courseCode>FACC 6850</courseCode><credit>6.00</credit><courseTitle>Financial Accountability Practicum</courseTitle><description>Placements in organizations provide students with the opportunity to explore the relationship between theory and practice in financial accountability as well as obtain relevant employment experience to prepare for careers.

If Cronenberg's horror upsets civil society by showing it inside-out, maybe it is because our anxiety over insurrection depends ultimately on whether we stand to gain or lose power by it. Cronenberg's oeuvre insists that, as long as social progress is the legitimating function of horror text, we will not have the vocabulary to really speak or dream horror's end. Skills in critical reading, writing, analysis and argument are required and will be further developed in the course. Students must be prepared to read and write numerous essays and a final exam.

It has careened from an open democracy to brutal dictatorship, been united, divided, and united again in a little over 100 years, embraced the rational optimism of the Enlightenment and the racism of Nazi Germany culminating in the Holocaust. This course examines cultural representations of contemporary and historical Germany from an interdisciplinary perspective. Examining cultural, political and social discourses, we will consider the tensions that have characterized ""Germany"" historically and in the present day through the lens of texts that include e.g. literature, film, art, journalistic and political writing. Particular attention will be paid to: Nationalism and multiculturalism, authority and resistance, competing visions of democracy or freedom, religion and rationalism, the role of Germany in Europe and the world, and the effect of the past on contemporary German society.

Published about 200 years ago, Brothers Grimms Fairy Tales remains one of the most iconic pieces of literature and has had significant influence on modern pop culture. This course examines fairy tales in the context of their longevity, their origins, and their ever changing roles in media and popular culture.</description></course><course><courseCode>GER 2000</courseCode><credit>6.00</credit><courseTitle>Intermediate German</courseTitle><description>Development of oral and written skills, intensive grammar review, introduction to cultural and literary readings.

To what extent are regulatory norms or practices influenced by broader social, political or economic developments, such as globalization, neo-liberalism, or technological determinism? What are the tools of regulatory intervention? Is the distinction between social and economic regulation a viable one? How does the idea of governance differ from the idea of regulation?

There are two overarching bases for the decision to combine contract and torts into one course. First, there is a natural overlap between these two substantive areas of law and as such there is a strong pedagogical reason for the study of these two areas in one course. Second, candidates for the LL.M. program will benefit from the additional opportunity provided to them to take one further subject course instead of taking two separate courses. From a pedagogical standpoint, there is merit to this combination of courses as it affords occasion to talk about the shape and inter-relationship of the common law categories. As this course is envisioned as an introduction, there is an effort to guide candidates through these legal disciplines in a manner that speaks to the distinct features as well as the overlapping points of each. The introduction to the course illustrates to candidates a common origin for contract and torts; thereby underlining the basis of the combination. Beginning with the discussion of remedies, the contemporary connection between contract and torts will be explored in more detail. Finally, candidates are taken through the business/economic scenarios in which contract and torts overlap.</description></course><course><courseCode>LAW 6517</courseCode><credit>3.00</credit><courseTitle>Introduction to Canadian Private Law</courseTitle><description>This course provides students with an introduction to private law in Canada.

There will be an emphasis on how theoretical understandings must underpin notions of pedagogy and classroom practice, and how practice can be interrogated in light of these theoretical frameworks. The expectation is that effective practitioners have a strong sense of what they know and how they know it, and what they are doing and why they are doing it. The general approach of the course will be exploratory rather than didactic. At all levels, learning can be thought of as research: an active construction of personal knowledge, based on formulating and testing hypotheses and, in light of an evaluation of the results, modifying one's beliefs and practices. In this spirit, we shall attempt to make connections between the reading, writing and discussion that take place in the course, and the reading, writing and discussion of the classroom setting. Class sessions will vary in format and will include discussions of the readings which are set for each week, lectures, guest presentations and work on individual and group projects.

In East Asia, the development of "modern" design histories began with cultural translation through Western culture in the late nineteenth century. The term "design" itself raises complex questions that are currently under investigation, reflecting an interest in cultural translation and transnational studies within postcolonial studies. This course will explore how modern design in East Asia has been adapted, practiced, theorized and discussed as an interactive process between heritage rich cultures of East Asia and modernism in the West. We will examine the terminology of "design" in the East Asian context, key designers and their works, movements, and definitions and developments-oriental modernity, nationalism and political ideology-within regional and international design frameworks. Through this examination, students will explore the significance of the connections between design artefacts and everyday life. This course will stimulate a transnational and interdisciplinary understanding of material culture in the age of globalization by reflecting on the past, present and future of East Asian design.</description></course><course><courseCode>MDES 5604</courseCode><credit>3.00</credit><courseTitle>Communication and the Sociotechnical: Perspectives, Debates, Applications</courseTitle><description>This reading and seminar course investigates some of the texts in the burgeoning study of society and technology that have inspired its major philosophical perspectives and frameworks of research.

The cyclical climate change of Earth has been due to changes in orbital obliquity, eccentricity and precession (related to the change of Earth's rotation axis, distance from the sun and rotation rate respectively). The course proceeds to examine the history of atmospheric pollution from natural causes such as volcanoes, natural fires, desert dust, etc., to pollution caused by humans prior to the industrial revolution arising from the burning of wood and the clearing of land. Subsequently, modern day pollution due to the burning of fossil fuels and production of other anthropogenic harmful chemicals will be discussed. Different forms of pollution such as manifested as smog and acid rain are discussed and past successes in dealing with these types of pollution are recounted. The course concludes with topics on new policies and technologies that can be considered to ameliorate the deleterious effects of atmospheric pollution, such as the usage of green energy (solar, wind, fuel cell, geo-thermal, biomass, etc.).

We begin by studying how gravity triggers fusion reactions in starts that create heat, light, and every element in our bodies except hydrogen: overall, stars shine by converting mass into energy (Einstein's E=mc^2). We discuss how we can use the corpses of stars (white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes) to probe how space and time are related via Einstein's theories of relativity. We examine how stars are bound together into galaxies by gravity and how to use various wavelengths of light to determine why there are different types of galaxies: elegant spirals, massive ellipticals, and faint dwarf galaxies. We learn how the Doppler effect reveals that dark matter must produce some of the gravity that binds stars into galaxies, galaxies into clusters of galaxies, and clusters of galaxies into superclusters. We explore how we can use distant galaxies to study the development of the universe over its entire history, including the increasing importance of dark energy. We confront both the earliest instants and the far future of our universe's history: what we know, what we still hope to learn, and what we think we can ever learn. Finally, we join some modern scientists in the speculation about whether or not other universes might exist beyond the one we can perceive. Course credit exclusions: SC/NATS 1740 6.00.

For each case we first cover a 'primer' on the technical issues - for instance learning how a gene codes for a protein - so that after this course when you come across such material you'll be better able to correctly grasp the relevant points. But we also study the enduring tension between expertise and democratic populism, the distinction between risk and uncertainty, and whether ignorance is a lack of knowledge....or the wrong knowledge confidently held.

The impact of measuring and marking time intervals on the development of human culture, and our understanding of the world around us, cannot be understated. The drive to measure and understand time led ancient peoples to a very sophisticated knowledge of the sky; from that knowledge emerged accurate calendars, as well as mathematics itself. We will look at how changing concepts of time and the technological accuracy of measuring time drove fundamental changes in physics, and deepened our understanding of the world around us. This course examines the history of physics through the lens of time. The first half of the course covers timekeeping methods, including the sky as a clock, mechanical clocks, and quartz and atomic clocks. The second half of the course focuses on modern issues of time including time perception, Einsteins revolutionary discoveries on the relative nature of time, and cosmic time.

Directed reading courses are given ex gratia by members of the faculty and the approval of the Program Director must be obtained in advance. This will not normally be given unless the Director is satisfied that the student has the appropriate background to pursue the course at a suitably advanced level.</description></course><course><courseCode>PHIL 6155</courseCode><credit>3.00</credit><courseTitle>Recent Trends in Continental Philosophy</courseTitle><description>This course examines a key thinker, theme, question or debate in recent continental philosophy.</description></course><course><courseCode>PHIL 6260</courseCode><credit>3.00</credit><courseTitle>Philosophy of Science</courseTitle><description>N/A</description></course><course><courseCode>PHIL 6290</courseCode><credit>3.00</credit><courseTitle>Philosophy of Logic</courseTitle><description>This course examines a topic in the philosophy of logic reviewing current work.

This course asks: What can we learn about international politics from popular culture? The common notions of international politics are certainly found in many of the expressions or contemporary popular culture: novels, television, and, particularly, film have made the world of international espionage one of its staples. With the declaration of a 'war on terror' in 2001, terrorists and the provision of security against them have also provided important themes for popular entertainments. However, by virtue of being 'popular', popular culture also presents the possibilities of politics that are not abstracted and insulated from the concerns and experiences of everyday life and experience. Thus, while international politics in popular culture can reproduce alienated or elite versions of our world's politics it can also be a site of resistance, and even more importantly a place to imagine international politics differently. This course draws the popular culture in which we all live in our 'daily' lives into the classroom, beginning from popular culture expressions to explore the nature, limits, and possibilities of contemporary international politics.

The function of memory in individual and collective identity has become an object of inquiry in many academic disciplines, introducing reflexive analysis of archiving processes into the long-standing evidentiary function of the archive in the historical study of empirical reality. The advent of digital technologies with their shift in the techniques of conservation and classification and a consequent rhetoric of instantaneity and simultaneity, has provoked a sense of imminent breakdown in the protocols of transmission of the traces of the past, even as digitization renews the utopian impulse of the archive in its embodiment of desire for mastery of a quasi-infinity of cultural materials. The dialectic of accumulation and dissemination-of hierarchization and destabilization--is only one of the paradoxes generated by the archive. Both a physical site--an enclosed institutional space--it is also an imaginative site, a conceptual space of changing limits. The physical space that contains them, the archive is also the material traces of the past so contained. Additionally, noun metamorphoses into a verb, associated with the ensemble of operations within this space that confers order on the contents in the creation of a system of classification so as to sift, interpret and transmit material traces. To archive documents is to enclose them in a myriad of complex containers--stone, metal, acid-free folders, or even electronic pulses--that structure the archivable content as it comes into existence and in its relation to the future. Archiving contributes thus to the transformation of documents into monuments with symbolic functions. Yet despite its etymology that signifies both "origin" and "command," the archive confounds beginnings and order alike as it exceeds the logic of historical temporality: its teleological function and claims to universality are short-circuited in its un</description></course><course><courseCode>SPTH 6674</courseCode><credit>3.00</credit><courseTitle>Diasporas: Transnational Communities and Limits of Citizenship</courseTitle><description>Provides a comparative inquiry about the nature of transnational communal, religious, and political identities at the age of late capitalism.

Fundamental concepts relevant to traditional and emerging sculptural production such as weight, mass, volume, context and space will be discussed in class and experienced through the execution of individual projects. The sculptural processes of basic metal fabrication will introduce students to a range of sculptural methodologies and skills employing forming, cutting, welding, chasing and finishing. Through in-class demonstrations students will be introduced to a range of skills and tools to be utilized in the production of their studio projects. Assignments will consist of series projects exploring different working processes and sculptural methodologies. In addition to these projects there will be in-class discussions, technical assignments and readings that will engage students in the dialogue surrounding contemporary concerns associated with abstraction and spatial awareness. Craftsmanship and a demonstrated knowledge of material are a major factor in this course. In order for students to be able to fully articulate their idea in a given material, they must understand the limits and possibilities inherent in the construction process. It is expected that each student will develop a degree of sophistication and competence when working with this material. Lectures, demonstrations, group critiques and most importantly, hands on instruction are the essential means by which we will investigate sculptural problem solving. The class will participate in material specific demonstrations and/or class critiques of finished work. Periodically there will be in-class work periods, but it is expected that the majority of the assignments will be completed outside of class time.</description></course><course><courseCode>VISA 2060</courseCode><credit>3.00</credit><courseTitle>Introductory Photography: Black and White</courseTitle><description>Focuses on the creation and production of black and white photographs in this hands-on studio course.
