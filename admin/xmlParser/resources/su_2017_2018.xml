For each idea/topic/problem relevant mathematical ideas and techniques are recalled and/or derived so as to provide a deeper understanding of the Economic issue and how it can be resolved, if necessary. The notion of Quantity Demanded is first addressed by expressing quantity demanded as a linear function of price where both the slope and intercept embed important Economics ideas. This sequence leads naturally to the notion of Revenue (the product of quantity demanded and price) where nonlinear functions are analyzed using mathematical techniques that include derivatives. This sequence culminates with notions of prices that maximize revenue subject to a given demand function. A large number of such topic sequences involving univariate functions are examined. Prerequisite: Grade 12U Advanced Functions or equivalent. Prerequisites/Co-requisites: AP/ECON 1000 3.00 or AP/ECON 1010 3.00, or equivalent.

Again, relevant mathematical ideas and techniques are recalled and/or derived so as to provide a deeper understanding of Economic issues and how they can be resolved. The issues and problems covered require functions of more than one variable for their resolution. The notion of Quantity Supplied is combined with the notion of Quantity Demanded and notions of Market Equilibrium are introduced and discussed. Equilibria are evaluated through the introduction of mathematical notions and properties of systems of equations, eventually in matrix form. A deeper understanding of theories of demand (supply) and the foundations of demand (supply) functions is developed through the introduction of mathematical notions of unconstrained and constrained optimization and linear and nonlinear programming. As in AP/ECON 1530 3.0, many topics and issues are addressed and problem framing and problem solving abilities are enhanced. Prerequisite: AP/ECON 1530 3.00 or equivalent.

This means that multilingual education is concerned with language policy. Language choices and uses in education reflect social policy decisions within a multicultural or cross-cultural context. In this course, we investigate language policy, education, ecology, and hegemony in our changing world. Multilingual education will be viewed in multiple ways, incorporating internal and international responses to globalization and multiculturalism. In our world today, people live in increasingly multicultural, multilingual countries where historical concepts of belonging are under pressure to respond to current cultural realities. Technological advances of the late twentieth century have simultaneaously provided people with the means to move around the globe much more easily and drawn edges of the world closer within virtual space, such that cross-glabal communications take place in nanoseconds. This has changed language use enormously in terms of both which languages we use most often and the media through which we communicate using these languages.</description></course><course><courseCode>EDUC 5409</courseCode><credit>3.00</credit><courseTitle>Policy Issues in Postsecondary Education</courseTitle><description>This course reviews Canadian postsecondary education policy issues with a focus on Ontario.

The first is to help students take a more structured and scientific approach to the evaluation of data. Managers are literally bombarded with data (the information overload problem) and must be able to filter and assess the quality of such data before inputting into managerial decision models. The ability to evaluate the quality of data and to make generalizations from it using the principles of statistical inference are critical skills for all mangers. The second objective of the course is to show how risk and uncertainty can be incorporated into decision making using techniques such as Probability theory and Bayesian inference. The third objective to show how data is qualitatively evaluated using the principles of evidence. Managers should be adept in evaluating both the sufficiency and persuasiveness of evidence used in decision models. The fourth objective is to show students how to prepare a research proposal to address any business problem. This is obviously essential for students pursuing the major paper option, but any manager benefits from recognizing when sound methodological principles have been followed in researching a business question. Managers read and possibly rely on many research reports over their careers and it is important to be able to distinguish good research from weak research.</description></course><course><courseCode>FACC 6500</courseCode><credit>3.00</credit><courseTitle>Corporate Governance</courseTitle><description>Effective corporate governance is crucial to a successful and sustainable corporate enterprise.

It is also a common belief that compensation schemes tied to the bottom line and stock price lead to actions more in the manager's interest than the firm's interest. This course looks at these issues and identifies best practices to strengthen corporate governance and accountability in the organization through appropriate design of executive compensation schemes. The revised course description reflects the reality that executive compensation dominates all benefits in terms of impact on accountability and governance.</description></course><course><courseCode>FACC 6800</courseCode><credit>3.00</credit><courseTitle>Synthesis of theory and practice, governance and accountability</courseTitle><description>Capstone course In the Graduate Program in Financial Accountability which integrates theories and practices from the previous courses and applies them in an experiential learning format.</description></course><course><courseCode>FACC 6850</courseCode><credit>6.00</credit><courseTitle>Financial Accountability Practicum</courseTitle><description>Placements in organizations provide students with the opportunity to explore the relationship between theory and practice in financial accountability as well as obtain relevant employment experience to prepare for careers.

This means that multilingual education is concerned with language policy. Language choices and uses in education reflect social policy decisions within a multicultural or cross-cultural context. In this course, we investigate language policy, education, ecology, and hegemony in our changing world. Multilingual education will be viewed in multiple ways, incorporating internal and international responses to globalization and multiculturalism. In our world today, people live in increasingly multicultural, multilingual countries where historical concepts of belonging are under pressure to respond to current cultural realities. Technological advances of the late twentieth century have simultaneaously provided people with the means to move around the globe much more easily and drawn edges of the world closer within virtual space, such that cross-glabal communications take place in nanoseconds. This has changed language use enormously in terms of both which languages we use most often and the media through which we communicate using these languages.</description></course><course><courseCode>LAL 6900</courseCode><credit>3.00</credit><courseTitle>Independent Study</courseTitle><description>N/A</description></course></courseSubject><courseSubject><courseSubjectCode>LAW </courseSubjectCode><courseSubjectTitle>Law</courseSubjectTitle><course><courseCode>LAW 6010</courseCode><credit>3.00</credit><courseTitle>Independent Research Paper</courseTitle><description>N/A</description></course><course><courseCode>LAW 6010A</courseCode><credit>3.00</credit><courseTitle>Independent Reading</courseTitle><description>TBA</description></course><course><courseCode>LAW 6040</courseCode><credit>3.00</credit><courseTitle>Directed Reading</courseTitle><description></description></course><course><courseCode>LAW 6040A</courseCode><credit>3.00</credit><courseTitle>Directed Reading</courseTitle><description></description></course><course><courseCode>LAW 6101P</courseCode><credit>1.00</credit><courseTitle>Advanced Legal Research Workshop</courseTitle><description>This course provides opportunities for students in the PDP LLM to increase their skills in various aspects of legal research in preparation for major paper research.</description></course><course><courseCode>LAW 6299P</courseCode><credit>6.00</credit><courseTitle>Teaching, Training and Coaching in Conflict Analysis and Dispute Resolution</courseTitle><description>This elective critically assesses teaching and training pedagogy, particularly for adult learners, and explores the growing field of conflict resolution coaching.</description></course><course><courseCode>LAW 6301P</courseCode><credit>6.00</credit><courseTitle>The Theory &amp; Practice of ADR</courseTitle><description>TBA</description></course><course><courseCode>LAW 6317P</courseCode><credit>6.00</credit><courseTitle>Major Research Paper</courseTitle><description>TBA</description></course><course><courseCode>LAW 6410</courseCode><credit>3.00</credit><courseTitle>Construction Law</courseTitle><description>This course provides an overview of major types of common construction contracts and ancillary construction contract issues.

There are two overarching bases for the decision to combine contract and torts into one course. First, there is a natural overlap between these two substantive areas of law and as such there is a strong pedagogical reason for the study of these two areas in one course. Second, candidates for the LL.M. program will benefit from the additional opportunity provided to them to take one further subject course instead of taking two separate courses. From a pedagogical standpoint, there is merit to this combination of courses as it affords occasion to talk about the shape and inter-relationship of the common law categories. As this course is envisioned as an introduction, there is an effort to guide candidates through these legal disciplines in a manner that speaks to the distinct features as well as the overlapping points of each. The introduction to the course illustrates to candidates a common origin for contract and torts; thereby underlining the basis of the combination. Beginning with the discussion of remedies, the contemporary connection between contract and torts will be explored in more detail. Finally, candidates are taken through the business/economic scenarios in which contract and torts overlap.</description></course><course><courseCode>LAW 6730P</courseCode><credit>3.00</credit><courseTitle>Managerial Tax Planning</courseTitle><description>TBA</description></course><course><courseCode>LAW 6737P</courseCode><credit>3.00</credit><courseTitle>Overview of United States Taxation and Recent Developments</courseTitle><description>N/A</description></course><course><courseCode>LAW 6783P</courseCode><credit>6.00</credit><courseTitle>Corporate and Financial Crime and Compliance</courseTitle><description>This course examines the ways in which criminal and regulatory law prevent harm in the conduct of commercial affairs, including the relationship between risk management and legislative rules or principles and procedures for regulatory offences.</description></course><course><courseCode>LAW 6810</courseCode><credit>6.00</credit><courseTitle>Political Law</courseTitle><description>Political law is the interdisciplinary study of the role of law in statecraft.
